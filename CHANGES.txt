0.2.2  September 28, 2009
- Manifest constructor now takes the universe an argument
- PyUnv source now conforms to PEP8 (thanks pep8!)

0.2.1  September 27, 2009
- Universe now shows object name (instead of index) in where clauses
- Reader now parses contexts
- Reader now handles universe files with "false" section markers
- Reader now differentiates between tables and aliases
- Reader now parses custom parameters from the universe file
- Added universe.ClassVisitor to make it easier to apply your own logic to the 
  class/object/condition tree
- Manifest template now displays universe statistics -- number of tables, classes,
  joins, etc.
- Manifest template no longer produces extra blank lines
- Universe now gracefully handles dangling references. When you delete a universe
  table, column, or object, Designer does not cleanup any references to the entity.

0.2.0  September 24, 2009
- Now parses universe joins
- Now sorts source database columns by id
- Added a few unittests and XI R2 test universes (more on the way)

0.1.9  September 23, 2009
- Added sample universes for unit tests
- Fixed a bug that caused manifests to show a condition's parent id instead of name.
- The manifest template now creates a manifest that resembles the PDF file 
created by Designer.
- setup.py now uses Setuptools instead of distutils
- This works now -- "python setup.py test"

0.1.8  September 18, 2009
- Restructured project folder to prepare for unit tests.
- Moved Subversion repository to Google Code.
- Borrowed setup.py settings from Python project.

0.1.7
- Fixes a bug with reading a source table that has certain metadata. This
  is a temporary workaround until I can decode this metadata.
- Now reads source columns from the universe file.

0.1.6
- Added the Manifest class to generate a text manifest for a BusinessObjects 
  universe. Manifest uses the Mako template engine.
- Reader.read_short_string now strips carriage returns and line feeds from
  universe strings. It returns a unicode string instead of a string tuple.

0.1.5
- First PyPi release
- Reads basic universe parameters, classes, objects, conditions, tables, and
  virtual tables.
- Tested with several BusinessObjects XI R2 universes and Python 2.6.
